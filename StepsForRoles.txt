*** If INVALID CREDENTIALS shows up, access is denied for the user. If it's the correct login for the role type, then this is an error. ***
*** If INVALID CREDENTIALS shows up, make sure you have created the user table and added the user as an entry. ***
*** If INVALID PRIVILEGES shows up, make sure you give the user the appropriate role type ***
